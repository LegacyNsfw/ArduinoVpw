V010 Adjusted VPW timing slightly.  Removed print for "Not programmed"
V009a a "-not programmed" shows up during the read some times.  Not sure why.  Turned on print for that
VPW_MEGA V009 user configurable (via A_Dec_prog) length and packet size. CRC on and off, Supress non bin data during a read.
VPW_MEGA V007a turned on check bit.  Fixed ending address.
VPW_MEGA V007 Moved Akn to ECU response to tester present instead of message rec'd.
